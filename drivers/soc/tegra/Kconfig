config TEGRA_BPMP_MAILMAN
	bool "Mailman driver for Tegra BPMP-lite mailbox"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA_210_SOC
	depends on TEGRA_BPMP_MBOX
	default y
	help
	  Say y here to support Tegra's BPMP-lite mailman driver.
	  If unsure say N.

config TEGRA_PROC_POWER_MODEL
	bool "Tegra process power model support"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA
	help
	  A simple model of processor power relating voltage, frequency,
	  cores, and chip specific data. Used by various drivers.

config TEGRA_CPU_EDP
	bool "Enforce electrical design limits on CPU rail (CPU EDP)"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA
	depends on CPU_FREQ && THERMAL
	default n
	select TEGRA_PROC_POWER_MODEL
	help
	  Enforce electrical design limits on CPU rail.
	  VDD_CPU EDP prevents the CPU from drawing more current than
	  its voltage regulator can supply.
	  Limit maximum CPU frequency based on temperature and number
	  of on-line CPUs to keep CPU rail current within power supply
	  capabilities.

config TEGRA_DVFS
	bool
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA
	help
	  This adds Tegra DVFS support. There could be several power
	  rails involved and there might be rails dependency based
	  on different SoCs, this config enable the generic DVFS
	  library needed by each SoCs DVFS files.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config TEGRA_124_DVFS
	bool "Tegra124 DVFS support"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA_124_SOC
	select TEGRA_DVFS
	help
	  This enable Tegra124 DVFS functionality, it implements SoC
	  specific initialization code to be invoked by probe function
	  defined in generic Tegra DVFS driver, so while enabled it
	  needs the config TEGRA_DVFS to be enabled as well.

config TEGRA_210_DVFS
	bool "Tegra210 DVFS support"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA_210_SOC
	select TEGRA_DVFS

	  This enable Tegra210 DVFS functionality, it implements SoC
	  specific initialization code to be invoked by probe function
	  defined in generic Tegra DVFS driver, so while enabled it
	  needs the config TEGRA_DVFS to be enabled as well.
